C++ Text Flat Filesystem is a flat filesystem for text files in C++

## Requirements
Since this uses [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse), you'll of course need a version of that installed, one from your favoured package manager will do.

On Windows you'll need an equivalent like [Dokan](https://dokan-dev.github.io).
